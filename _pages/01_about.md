Currently, I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://aurora.tech" target="_blank">Aurora</a>, where we are building autonomous driving capabilities for trucks and cars, in a safe, quick, and scalable manner.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.perceptiveautomata.com/" target="_blank">Perceptive Automata</a>, where we engineered software to allow autonomous driving vehicles to understand and interact with pedestrians around them.

Before that, I was a Computer Vision Engineer at <a href="https://www.eyenuk.com/" target="_blank">Eyenuk</a>. where we developed state-of-the-art FDA-approved AI software that helps in diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in middle-aged people around the world.

And of course, I was a student before that! I graduated with an M.S. from <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst</a>, and a B.Tech. from <a href="https://cse.iitj.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Jodhpur</a>.

As is obvious from my jobs, my primary interests lie in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. For a detailed look, please refer to my Resume <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6778yfjp6zbiky/Nishit_Parekh_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
